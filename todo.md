TODO:

- Completely generate the new DB, since we added a new column. All radius 2-200.
- Implement the uniformity value in the from-db version. When it reads and displays the data, include the uniformity value.

LATER TODO:

- Replace CSV export with a method to export the currently viewed circle as a Scrap Mechanic blueprint (directly to the blueprint's folder). This will require the minimal-prisms calculation from my other project. And need to figure out how to handle wedges in the blueprints file format.
